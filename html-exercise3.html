    <h1>A Little Good News / Anne Murray - Lyrics</h1>
    <div>
        <span> I rolled out this morning kids had the morning news show on<br>
            Bryant Gumbel was talking about the
            fighting in Lebanon<br>
            ome senator was squawking about the bad economy<br>
            It's gonna get worse you see we need a change in policy</span>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <span>There's a local paper rolled up in a rubber band<br>One more sad story's one more than I can stand<br>
            Just once, how I'd like to see the headline say<br>
            Not much to print today can't find nothing bad to say</span>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <span>Because nobody robbed a liquor store on the lower part of town<br>
            Nobody OD'd, nobody burned a single building down<br>
            Nobody fired a shot in anger nobody had to die in vain<br>
            We sure could use a little good news today</span>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <span>I'll come home this evening I'll bet that the news will be the same<br>Somebody takes a hostage somebody
            steals a plane<br>
            How I wanna hear the anchor man talk about a county fair<br>
            And how we cleaned up the air how <br>everybody learned to care</span>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <span>Whoa, tell me nobody was assassinated in the whole Third World today<br>And in the streets of Ireland all
            the children had to do was play<br>
            And everybody loves everybody in the good old USA<br>
            We sure could use a little good news today</span>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <span>Nobody robbed a liquor store on the lower part of town<br>Nobody OD'd, nobody burned a single building
            down<br>
            Nobody fired a shot in anger nobody had to die in vain<br>
            We sure could use a little good news today</span>
    </div>
